# concert-reviews
REST API for a concert/festival review web application using Spring Boot with MySQL database.

This concert review system is based on the many factors that go into what makes a show great. These factors include the production, sound, food, restrooms, merch, parking, security, as well as the attractions some have. These ratings are on a 1-10 scale with the ability to leave a comment as well describing their experience.
Each concert will have a name, date, and the organizer who puts on the show. Each concert will have a venue where it is located with the name, street, city, state, and zip. Users will be able to post, update, and delete their reviews along with viewing what others have posted.
